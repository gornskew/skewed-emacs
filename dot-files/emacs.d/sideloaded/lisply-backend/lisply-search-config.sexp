;;; Consumed by lisply-search.el (`lisply-search-services-path').
;;;
;;; This lived inside the stack's services.sexp until 2026-08-15, purely
;;; because that file was the only single-source-of-truth around.  It never
;;; belonged there: nothing in the stack generator ever read it, and its
;;; only consumer has always been lisply-search.el, which ships here.
;;; Renamed 2026-09-09 together with the tool (skewed_search ->
;;; lisply_search); the reader still accepts the old file name and the old
;;; :skewed-search-config top-level key.
;;;
;;; Each source entry:
;;;   :root      where the corpus lives, relative to /projects (the host
;;;              mount in dev; cloned into the image at build time)
;;;   :repo-url  cloned when :root is missing -- so a private repository
;;;              needs a credential at build time (docker/build
;;;              CORPUS_NETRC); without one that corpus is skipped and the
;;;              build logs SOURCE MISSING
;;;   :repo-root the repository's own directory when the corpus is only a
;;;              subdirectory of it (the clone lands here; hits are
;;;              reported relative to it)
;;;   :sparse    subdirectories to check out when the corpus is a small
;;;              part of a large repository
;;;   :branch    overrides the build's branch for that clone (optional)

;;; services-discovery.el --- Load services from SSoT or generated file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides service discovery for the dashboard, SLIME connections,
;; and other Emacs integrations.
;;
;; It can load services from either:
;;   1. services-generated.el (fast, pre-generated)
;;   2. services.json (legacy, runtime parsing)
;;   3. services.sexp (SSoT, runtime parsing - for development)
;;
;; The SSoT (services.sexp) generates all config files including docker-compose.yml
;; and MCP configs. Run (skewed-generate-all-configs) after editing services.sexp.

;;; Code:
